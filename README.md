The folder `Ocean Script` provides the script that I used with the following data from: 
```Webber B.G.M.; Matthews A.; Queste B.Y.; Lee G.A.; Cobas-Garcia M.; Heywood K.J.; Vinayachandran P.N.(2019). Ocean glider data from five Seagliders deployed in the Bay of Bengal during the BoBBLE (Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment) project in July 2016. British Oceanographic Data Centre, National Oceanography Centre, NERC, UK. doi:10/dgvj.```

**Linear models, and statistical results are present in the R-script**

**Methodology**

The data for ID - 579 was extracted using R-studio, using the packages `ncdf4` and `getNCTime` to effectively retrieve the coordinates, oxygen, depth and time from the netCDF file. Furthermore, a template map was taken from an R-repositry this was to overlay the coordinates from the glider data to check whether it matches the metadata. The data went through a filtering process to select for individual dates and duration, and finally it was made into a raster than aggregated by a factor of 20 to increase the resolutionary scale to provide a finer grain to pixel size, figure 1.

Lastly, the data went through a series of further filtering to group the values of depth and oxygen at intervals, the interval was calculated by dividing the max value by 10 and taking a sequence of that product from 0 to the max value, table 1.

Statistical tests were then performed, and these were a multiple linear regression and a stepwise forward selection for the Minimum-Adequate Model (MAM). Given that the data had poor normality, it was then normalised under a log distribution. While the histogram continued to show slight skewness, the linear models were implemented regardless, figure 2.

Figure 2. A stepforward selection of the Count data and Categorical covariates were fitted 

#Linear model shows that as the number of counts collected from the glider for increases, then it declines as the days progress
#A lot of negative estimates, perhaps related towards the decline in accuracy and data-collection from the float over-time
#Counts increase with depth, though increase in counts have a potential decrease in oxygen increase?
#Though a better test may be necessary given that normality was weak, and further assumptions will need to be considered like colinearity between variables.



**Extra notes:**
Below is a map for flag points regarding Oxygen, as you can see they're detected and aligned on the Bay of Bengal as the data suggests. This was only used for ID - 579. Unfortuntely, I couldn't manage any effective way to collect all the time data from the dataset, as the metadata suggest it spans up to 20 days, I could only retrieve data from July 02 2016 - July 17 2016. :

Below is a zoomed in image of the floating points, because these are values of Oxygen then the darker green represents higher Oxygen concentrations and the lighter contrast represent lower Oxygen concentrations. Although, this approach limits the amount of points per grid-cell, failing to provide a concise distribution of the gliders path.
The time-series map show variations in Oxygen concentrations throughout the day, although consistent throughout the weeks, day 16 has a strong anamolous trend in comparison to previous days.

Limitations:
The previous map minimises the coordinates per grid-cell to save on memory, therefore not all values from the dataset can be used per grid-cell. To resolve this, a better map with more points per grid-cell would provide a stronger indication, visually on the spatial trends in oxygen fluctuations. Whilst there is no overlay for figure 1, onto another map because of differences in resolution (rescaling to a finer resolution may fix this), it provides a stronger perception of the distribution of points provided by the floats, and the oxygen levels. A larger proportion are distributed at the lower scale and surprisingly at larger depth (Further surprise is that higher concentrations of oxygen are prevalent at the surface, then diminish and lower concentrations are apparent at deeper depth - Inferring that a large-number of phytoplankton are present at the surface.)
